The results differed by ~9%. We theorize that due to not being able to do 0.2/0.8 method with 30lb weight that the conventional measurement was biased high. The FT2 measurement contained many 0.2/0.8 panels. Greater confidence is given to the wading measurement.  Wading FT2 mmt 10m D/S of gauge. Secondary conventional cable mmt completed. Both mmts are high confidence, however the cableway mmt plots much better than the wading mmt. FT2 mmt taken at a similar time last year also did not plot well.

Past comparison of discharge between the two locations (2006-2011) has indicated that there is approximately 20 percent of flow that is not being measured at the highway location. It should be noted that a large standard deviation results from this grouping of comparison measurement (12%).  This 20% has been added to the highway location measurements between 2009 and the spring period of 2020.  2022-03-28 - Recent recession work has suggested the 20% added to the highway location measurements may be too much (i.e. recession often exceeds shifted discharge with curve 60.0). High confidence measurements obtained on this date suggest a 9% difference in flow. While further comparison measurements are certainly required, it is thought that the signficantly more recent comparison measurement and recession analysis results deem it necessary to revise the inflow addition to 9%.

Due to inflow between this measurement site and the gauge, past comparison of discharge between the two locations has indicated that there is approximately 20 percent of flow that is not being measured at the highway location and therefore this amount is added to the measured flow from the highway location.
