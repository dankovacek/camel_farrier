02YR003,17.0,New curve #17.00 created for 2021.  This was a low water change from curve #16.01 based on a very low water measurement obtained.  The change occured at GH of 4.300m and below.  This curve change was based on 4 open water measurements taken in 2021.,LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(4.17);
02YR003,16.01,No curve change for 2020.  Curve 16.01 created to make change to grade table based on low measurement obtained.,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(4.17);
02YR003,16.0,New Curve # 16 developed for 2017 based on 2017 measurements.  This is a very small low water refinement at water level 4.80 meters and below,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(4.17);
02YR003,15.0,New Curve # 15 developed for 2016 based on 2016 measurements.  This is a low to medium water refinement at water level 5.33 meters and below,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(4.17);
