08KE016,69.00,This curve is similar to previous Curve 68.00 with amendments to account for scour during high water in 2023. Open water measurements from 2023 and high measurements from 2018 were used to create the curve. There is a breakpoint at 1.660m (similar to curve # 68.00) where large boulders in the channel are submerged at that stage. The offset of 1.17 m is estimated point of zero flow based on site photos.,LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(1.66:1.17);(1.485);
08KE016,68.00,This curve is similar to previous Curve 67.00 with an adjustment to the lower end to account for sedimentation. Open water measurements from 2022 and high measurements from 2018 were used to create the curve. There is a breakpoint at 1.660m where large boulders in the channel are submerged at that stage. The majority of measurements collected in 2021 also plot on this curve creating additional confidence.,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(1.66:1.052);(1.484);
