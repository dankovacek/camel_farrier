10AC005,21.01,"BP established at 0.647m ; observations of control on 2018-09-18 suggest that channel geometry changes at this stage (slightly lower elevation than measurement MGH on this day). A gravel bar becomes exposed at the control riffle and bisects the channel below this stage. No open-water measurements exist below this stage, so the lower rating point was defined using historic marginally ice-affected measurements, and guided by Curve 19.00 and 20.00. The low E grade was assigned below 8.01 cms (breakpoint discharge) since the curve has high uncertainty below this point. Adjusted low E"" grade for C21.01 based on 2021-10-14 mmnt.""",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(0.647:0.3);(0.359);
