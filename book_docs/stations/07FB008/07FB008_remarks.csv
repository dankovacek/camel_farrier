07FB008,2,2017,"Flow measurement location changed effective 2016.  The new measurement location is 2.5 km downstream of the historic location. Comparison measurements between the two sites were completed in the stage range around +/- 1.400m.  These comparison measurements consistently indicate that the newer, downstream location results in a lesser discharge for the same given stage as the upstream location, most likely due to instream channel loss. These differences range in the +/-10% band.",
