07BG004,5.0,"Flood event in June scoured out all dams as well as the built-up silt. Curve drawn from 2 mmts before beaver activity resumed. The breakpoint at 0.98 is for the reach, whereas 0 flow is estimated to occur around 0.4m based on a measurement on the riffle control on July 31.Upper segment of the curve estimated using estimated LSPIV MMTS from 2018 as well as a cableway measurement from the 80s. Slope area measurements were not considered in this case.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(0.4);
