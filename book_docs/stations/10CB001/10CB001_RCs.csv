10CB001,55.0,Curve 55.00 was created using 2023 open water measurements. The upper end of the curve was defined using a high water measurement from 2001. The low end of the curve was defined using a low-water measurement from September 2023. A breakpoint was added at 1.870m because this is an estimated elevation where the river channel comes into contact with a defined shelf of rip rap on the left bank.,LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(1.87:0.08);(-1.9);
