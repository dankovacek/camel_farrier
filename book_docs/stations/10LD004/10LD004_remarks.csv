10LD004,2,2011,(Discharge) The maximum instantaneous and flows occurred during a period of missing record and are not available. (Water Level) Referred to assumed datum. The maximum instantaneous and daily mean water levels and occurred during a period of missing record and are not available.,
10LD004,2,2012,(Discharge) Flow data under backwater was determined by hydrograph interpolation. The maximum instantaneous and daily flows occurred during a period of missing record and are not available. The minimum mean daily discharge value occurred under backwater conditions but is considered valid. (Water Level) The maximum instantaneous and daily mean water levels occurred during a period of missing record and are not available,
10LD004,2,2013,(Water Level) The maximum instantaneous and daily mean water levels flows occurred during a period of missing record and are not available. The minimum instantaneous and mean daily water level values could not be verified. (Discharge) The maximum instantaneous and daily mean flows occurred during a period of missing record and are not available. The minimum mean daily discharge value occurred under backwater conditions but is considered valid. Max/Min instantaneous and daily discharge all likely occurred during periods of missing or periods of updated record,
