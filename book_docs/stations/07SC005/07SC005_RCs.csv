07SC005,4.0,"Curve 4.00 was created in October 2023 with the benefit of additional information since the data was originally computed. The rating period for curve 4.00 begins January 1, 2019 and remains active through 2023.  Despite the bedrock control, a high degree of variability exists below 7.5m or approximately 3.0CMS.    The model was created  using all 7 open water measurement from 2019-2023, of which 6 plot within 5%.  Simplicity of a single point rating was selected over adding complexity with the break point used in Curve 3.  Extensive shifting will be necessary regardless due to the low-end scatter.  It was determined an extrapolation of the curve from the historically stable upper end was more defensible than adding theorized break points that will still require a complex shifting regime.   � The dataset displays an unconventional trend of measurements taken under ice conditions plotting significantly to the right.  This attributed to the theorized siphoning effect documented to validate the extreme changes in stage that occur annually under ice conditions.  The station should be relocated to avoid the site specific hydraulic interference.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(6.97);
