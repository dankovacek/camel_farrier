07UC001,10.0,"Rating of best fit using all open water measurements and any april may measurements that plot.  All measurements plotting left (backwater) are early/mid winter measurements.  One open water measurement was disregarded for rating creation as it plotted 10% to the right (no vegetation growth - suggests true open water and can be used as a early spring shift - pre vegetation).  Good exponent, all open water mmnts plot +/- 5% with a mean of 3%.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(2.094);
