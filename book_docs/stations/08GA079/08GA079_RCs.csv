08GA079,22.0,"Curve #22.00 was created after the high water events during November of 2021 changed the stage-discharge relationship above the reservoir at both Seymour River Below Orchid Creek (08GA077) and Seymour River Above Lakehead (08GA079).   This high-water event scoured materials from the control at Seymour River Above Lakehead with conditions remaining throughout the 2022 review period. Curve #22.00 is a representation of this scour relative to the previously applicable curve. This curve was developed using five measurements starting with the measurement on 2022-03-07. The high water rating point was determined using both the highest measurement on record along with the highest recent measurement taken on 2023-01-13. The low water rating point was determined using the lowest measurement on record taken on 2022-10-17. On an annual basis, conditions at the station enter backwater when reservoir levels are allowed to rise in anticipation of diminishing summer supply. This year this took place between 2022-06-17 and 2022-07-31.  The lower confidence limit is set at 0.112m3/s; half the discharge of the lowest measurement on record. The higher confidence limit is set at 138 m3/s; double the discharge of the most recent high water measurement that was also used to determine the high water rating point.  Further measurements across the range of stage will further help to refine and develop this newly established relationship described by Curve #22.00.  In the development of Curve #22.00, a relationship based on basin ratio between 08GA077 and 8GA079 was used as a check to maintain relative discharge levels between stations throughout the year. This relationship changes during low water periods, where more water is found upstream at 08GA077 than downstream at 08GA079 due to losses to groundwater in the 4 km between stations.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(8.752);
