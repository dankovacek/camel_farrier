07SB013,6.0,"Rating of overall best fit  and HIGH STATISTICAL CONFIDENCE, utilizing all historical mmnts between May and October to eliminate any possibility of ice effect.  2 open water mmnts were removed as they were outliers within the entire group and trend and should be shifted.  Rating shows significant scatter throughout and considering that the shifts can be extremely small at the low end with extreme results in % error,",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(29.0589);
07SB013,5.0,"Rating Curve 5.000 was created in response to recent (ie. acoustic) measurements all plotting consistently to the right of curve 4.000 and with similar shifts. It was determined that 4.000 was drawn to theoretical 0.001cms measurements that in practice did not align with what was being measured with modern instrumentation. The curve was redrawn with an emphasis on letting measurements at higher Qs tell the story; the thesis being that as one gets closer to zero flow the measurements are affected by errors inherant within our operating procedures, as evidenced by shifts of only a few militmeters being the determining factor if a measurement plots on or off the curve. Given that our level circuits have a closure error allowance of 0.003m and the potential for bias in non volumetric discharge measurements at low Qs this approach was determined to be the most sound.",LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(29.04);
