08AA008,17.01,"Curve 17.0 not extended low enough for shifting of winter discharge. Extended to 0.001cms. NO ESTIMATED grade applied at lower end. Rationale: Low flow occurs only in the winter. Winter measurements are consistently obtained and they are shifted to or recession analysis is applied and are thereby graded as ICE. There is scatter at the very low end (which would be expected) and choosing a measurement to apply the �1/2� SOP rule would be difficult and subjective. Creating an average curve from mmnts from 2010 to 2019, high amount of varriation in mmnts due to sand control, potential BW caused by Aishihik Lake and Wetlands DS on Sekulmun River, and  MGH levels come from Lake Stn ~3km away from river.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(2.02);
