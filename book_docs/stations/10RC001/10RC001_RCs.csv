10RC001,17.000,"Channel control consisting of cobble/stone and boulders and is considered stable, with no evidence of scour or deposition evident in the rating curve for the decades since the station was established. The control is considered stable. Curve 17.000 created to replace older CompuMod software derived rating curve and uses all measurements from July to September and measurements from June that plot, 6 June measurements were excluded due to evidence of ice indicated on hydrometric survey notes or plotting significantly away from the curve if not otherwise specified on the hydrometric survey notes. The majority of June visits with easily accessible hydrometric survey notes indicate the presence of possible backwater conditions, even towards the end of June. The new curve is well defined and draws on the statistical strength of measurements at the entire range of stage, except the extremes. Measurements span several decades and use a variety of technologies that plot consistently. Curve parameters are reasonable with an offset of 0.2700, which is difficult to validate as the point of zero flow has not been surveyed and the depths can vary significantly within the reach of channel control, particularly between the gauging pool and measurement section. Exponent of 1.987 is reasonable given measurement profiles are generally somewhere between parabolic and rectangular, again the exact shape of the channel control may vary within the reach between gauging pool and measurement section. A possibility of a breakpoint at around 5.75m as a downstream outcrop becomes submerged was considered but ultimately not included due to the addition of complexity supported by minimal data, producing only a minor difference in the equation of the upper segment, and the creation of a transition zone where stage would not be predictive of discharge. Discharge residuals exhibit a pattern of negative shifts at the low end and positive shifts at the high end, as well as higher variance at the high end, somewhat supportive of the breakpoint, but ultimately the majority of selected measurements plot within 5%, and when normalized by the discharge, the residuals pattern is minimal. Although some measurements within the 25-50cms under-ice range seem to plot, the curve was not extended that far as it is believed that at least in some years the gauging pool becomes isolated from the main flow by ice, resulting in questionable relationship between stage and discharge and significantly higher measurement scatter at the low end of the curve, if it was to be extended down that far. Ultimately, curve 17.000 is within 5% of CompuMod derived curve 16.000 within the entire range of observed stage-discharge measurement pairs, and differs only at the extreme high end and extreme low end. Curve 16.000 also extended down to the 25-50cms range while 17.000 was extended down only to approximately 100cms due to the suspected breakdown of the stage-discharge rating described above. It is expected that this first version of the modernized post-CompuMod curve will be refined over time.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(0.27);
