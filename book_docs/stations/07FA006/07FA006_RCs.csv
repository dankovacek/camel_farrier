07FA006,38.0,"Curve 38.00 was created using open water discharge measurements collected in 2023. The upper end of the curve was defined using a high water measurement from 2020. The lower end of the curve was defined using low water measurements from 2023. A breakpoint was added at a stage of 1.240m. Based on NuPoint photos, an island that splits the river into two channels is completely submerged at this stage. Additional measurements are required to strengthen the confidence level in the curve.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(1.24:-0.39);(-0.02);
07FA006,37.0,Curve 37.00 was created using open water discharge measurements collected in 2022. The upper end of the curve was defined using a high water measurement from 2020. The lower end of the curve was defined using a low water measurement from 2022. Additional measurements are required to strengthen the confidence level in the curve. Shifts were applied to plot August 2022 measurement within 5%.,LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(-0.69);
07FA006,36.0,"Channel dramatically changed after peak flows reached on June 15, 2020, and low measurements continued to plot further right in 2021.  This curve reflects the 2021 measurements and post-July 2020 high water measurements.",LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(-0.73);
07FA006,35.0,"Channel dramatically changed after peak flows reached on June 15, 2020.  This curve reflects the measurements (from BM 12) captured afterwards, as well as high mmt from 2017.  2012 high mmt. was omitted.",LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(-0.624);
07FA006,34.0,"Created using open water measurements from 2019, and the first 3 measurements in 2020.  The MGH are from the main channel. (previous curve was using the side channel) Upper end was defined using the historic measurements from 2017 and 2012",LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(-0.172);
07FA006,33.0,Control change: gravel bar growing. For 2018 open water mmt.,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(1.25:-0.59);(0.95);
07FA006,32.0,This curve has a breakpoint at 1.3 with a large offset change (-0.35 to 1.142).  There is a 0.5m transition zone around this breakpoint  where there is more variance in the measurements.  Curve 32.000 is different than 31.000 on the top end due to high mmts done in 2017.,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(1.3:-0.35);(1.142);
07FA006,31.0,This curve has a breakpoint at 1.3 with a large offset change (-0.35 to 0.9).  There is a 0.5m transition zone around this breakpoint  where there is more variance in the measurements.  The top end will not be confirmed until the cableways are reinstated.,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(1.3:-0.35);(0.9);
