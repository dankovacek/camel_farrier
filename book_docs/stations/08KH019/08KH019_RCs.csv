08KH019,54.00,"Only one of the four open water measurements in 2023 plotted within 5% of curve #53.01. A new curve #54.00 was created for the 2023 review period. This curve was defined by the 2023 open water measurements and high-water measurements from 2020 and 2022. The hydraulic section control at this location is a downstream riffle characterized by cobbles and small boulders with a roughly parabolic/triangular cross-section. The thalweg is along left bank. At higher flows, this riffle becomes submerged and the reach switches to channel control. A breakpoint was chosen based on photos of the downstream control where the low-water riffle becomes submerged at approximately ~ 1.3 m. An offset/point of zero flow was also estimated as 0.9 m based on photos of the gauging reach and results of recent rating models. The channel is still shifting each year since the high-water event that partially washed out the station in 2020.   Curve #54.00 was overlaid with #53.01 and it was found that the measurements after June 2022 all also plotted on #54.00. Therefore, it is likely that the control shifted during peak in 2022. The transition to curve #54.00 was done under-ice immediately after the start of the 2023 approval period.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(1.3:0.897);(1.148);
08KH019,53.00,Curve 53.00 was created for the 2022 review period because four out of five open water measurements collected plotted off of previous curve 52.00. This curve was created using 2022 open water measurements. Additional measurements are required to validate curve 53.00.,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(0.922);
