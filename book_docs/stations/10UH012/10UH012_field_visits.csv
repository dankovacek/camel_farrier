Large Blizzard has filled in and frozen the main channel.  Looks like the water piled up and eroded a channel past the gauge shelter to the side channel.  Furthermore, it appears that the extra flow from gauge pool to side channel has eroded a fair amount of soil/vegetation/small rocks.  High liklihood that the conditions will warrant a new rating.  Once the area completely thaws, as many open water measurements as possible should be obtained.","Poor quality wading measurement of side channel.
