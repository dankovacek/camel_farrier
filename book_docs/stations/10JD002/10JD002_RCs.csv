10JD002,6.0,Curve using all measurements to date. Its believed that there is a breakpoint in the 4.75-5.5m range as evidenced by the September 2017 visit and photos taken on that date. The measurement taken during that visit seems to plot as an outlier in other attempts to produce a rating curve without a breakpoint located at a similar stage. The measurement was reviewed and no reason to dismiss it was found. Future ratings will likely need to refine the specific location of the breakpoint further as more measurements are collected.,LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(5.4:2.72);(2.93);
