08MH155,2,2016,"During the period 2016 to 2019, the benchmark network was reduced to two temporary bench mark reference points which have demonstrated instability with each other.  Since no third reference point was available, and a defined error of +/- 0.010 m exists between the two Temporary Bench Marks in place for this period, a degree of uncertainty exists as to the stability of the gauge datum.",
