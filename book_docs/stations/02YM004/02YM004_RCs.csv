02YM004,20.0,"Curve # 20.00  was created for 2022.  This curve is a clone of Curve # 19.00 with a low water refinement based on 2 Sept 15 2022, low water Measuremnts. The refinement is below Gauge Height 3.420, above this gauge height it is the same as Curve # 19.00. Start date is at high water peak 2022-04-18 @ 17:20",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(2.73);
02YM004,19.0,Curve # 19.00  was created for 2021.  This curve was created based on 9 open water measurements taken in 2021.  This curve is a change / refinement to medium range (Curve #18.00)  to better fit the 2021 open water measurements.,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(2.73);
02YM004,18.0,Curve # 18.00  was created for 2020.  This curve was created because of 5 open water measurements taken in 2020.  This curve is a slight refinement on both high and low ends compared to previous curve #17.00,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(3.401:2.73);(2.85);
02YM004,17.0,Curve # 17.00  was created for 2019.  This curve was created because of 5 open water measurements taken in 2019.  This curve is a slight refinement on both high and low ends compared to previous curve #16.00,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(3.401:2.84);(2.85);
02YM004,16.0,"Curve # 16.00  was created for 2018.  On the January 13, 2018, there was a high water event and a significant ice run.  Thus, the decision was made to start the curve on this date.  A total of 6 measurements were obtained during the open water of 2018.  Based on these results a medium to low water change was required below 3.744m.",LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(3.5209:2.84);(2.81);
