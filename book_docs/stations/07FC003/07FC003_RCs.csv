07FC003,49.0,Rating curve 49.00 was created using open water discharge measurements collected in 2022. A break point was added in order to plot 2022 measurements within 5%. There is little confidence in the lower end of the curve due to the lack of measurements collected at lower stages. The lower end of the curve was graded as estimated from the breakpoint.,LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(2.09:1.48);(1.69);
