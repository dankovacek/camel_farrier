07SB010,11.0,"Mean Rating developed for high statistical confidence.  Almost all measurements are used from May 1st to September 30th.  It is noted that October measurements generally show a fairly significant shift to the left in H/Q relationship.  It is hypothesized that this is due to possible debris on control.  The HQ plot of measurements was observed both linear and log/log to assess a significant point where a control transition (breakpoint) is possible.  At low water, most flow is concentrated to RHB in a triangular chute of a small waterfall.  At higher stages, more flow is distributed across the smooth, bedrock shelf extending to the LHB.  Measurement locations at lower flows tend to be opportunistic, leading to increased possibility of external influences depending on where the measurements are taken (Q<3cms).  Measurements taken at extreme flows in 1991 were considered valid, but a breakpoint was inserted for the creation of the rating.  It is likely that the control is affected by shoreline vegetation at 2.81m, leading to backwater conditions during those measurements.  A photo of the control May 11, 2018 shows the stage 1m lower than the breakpoint and shows a cutbank and vegetation around the 2.81m elevation, which would affect the relationship.  Should the levels/flow reach that point again, it is recommended that more discharge measurements be made for validation.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(1.944:1.372);(2.816:1.744);(1.8);
07SB010,9.0,Curve drawn as successor to compumod curve 7.000 in an effort to move away from imported curves. Curve was designed using historical measurements to 2015 and 2018 which tend to agree with curve 7.000. Curve 8.000 will not be used as it was more heavily weighted to 2016/2017 measurements that were determined to have a higher uncertainties and bias due to the poor measurment conditions under the Ingram Trail highway bridge. Moving forward measurements will be attempted immediately downstream of the gauge at the constriction below the campground with accoustics. Future measurements and curve development should be assessed carefully as any large changes on the low end indicated by new measurements is more likely a result of instrumentation then an actual change in the clearly observable bedrock control.,LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(2.03:1.48);(1.868);
