02ZD002,16.0,New curve # 16.000 created for 2021. This is a slight refinement at medium and low stages of #15.00 based on 2018 to 2021 discharge measurements that showed a consistant trend to the left of rating 15.00. The refinement occurred below Stage 3.00. Above 3.00 the curve is a clone of # 15.00. The Start date for rating 16.00 is Apr 06 2021 (high Water event),LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(2.5757:1.35);(1.35);
02ZD002,15.0,"New curve # 15.000 created for 2017.  This is due to major river change from 100yr storm that occured on Oct 10th, 2016. Curve completed changed below Break Point at 2.58m GH. Then blended into previous curve #14.000 due to having no measurements above 2.58m GH",LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(2.5757:1.35);(1.35);
02ZD002,14.0,Curve # 14 slight refinement below gauge height 2.500 meters based on 2015 Meter measurement results to bring them within 5% of the rating,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(2.5573:1.35);(1.35);
