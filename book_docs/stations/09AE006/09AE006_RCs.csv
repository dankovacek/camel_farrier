 the one half of lowest measured discharge measurement is the lowest flow measurement since 2013 on record. Careful observation and documentation of the control will aid in the subsequent application of ICE and/or ESTIMATED grades during winter discharge.   Covers historical ranges of stage and discharge. Graded as 'Estimated' below 1.12cms/3.114m (2.24cm / 2 = 1.12cms). No 'Estimated' grade applied at upper end. 188cms/5.353m X 2 = 376cms/6.666m. BM 5 (Gauge plate on LB bridge pier, 28m E of shelter under bridge. Across river from shelter.) is 6.162m. As the sensor is located beneath bridge it may be possible that some hydraulic effect occurs at high stage as the pier 'pinches' the flow before entering the curve in the channel. This theory does not appear to have influenced the record high measurement. As no higher measurements have been obtained," SOP guidelines are followed for the upper rating curve until proven incorrect.""",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(3.95:2.6);(3.7);
