10KA009,9.000,"A new curve #9.000 was drawn as some minor adjustments were required.  Top end moved slightly to the left as 3 of the 4 measurements were all negative suggesting the curve was biased right.  That singular positive shift measurement is believed to show a scour event in 2021.  Bottom end of the curve�s rating point was moved very slightly but not in any significant way. Measurement conditions at this site are not particularly conducive to precise discharge measurements.  The riverbed consists of limestone cobbles and is generally irregular.  This creates measurement conditions with high flow angles, irregular flow distributions and irregular depths.  Vegetation and silting are not considered factors of concern at this site.  If a measurement is conducted in the late season and freezing conditions are afoot low SNR values could be of concern.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(6.42);
