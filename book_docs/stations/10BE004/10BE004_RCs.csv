10BE004,34.0,"- Single segment curve (33.0) does not model measurements above ~100cms properly. It appears there is a control change at approximately a 2m stage.  - Covers historical range of stage and discharge.   - 'Estimated' grade applied at lower end. Applied below 9.9cms (19.8cms / 2 = 9.9cms) and curve extended to 1cms.  - 'Estimated' grade applied at upper end. Applied above 472cms (236cms X 2 = 472cms) and extended to upper rating point at historic discharge peak of 600m/4.149m. BM 11 (BOTTOM OF SG ON RB STEEL WING DEFLECTOR) is 4.196m. Due to proximity to the bridge piers and wingwalls, the stage/discharge relationship at the upper end may not be accurate. It is highly likely that flows exceeding this elevation would enter a new control condition (likely backwater due to bridge components).",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(2:0.4);(1);
10BE004,33.0,"Curve 33.0 is a logarithmic curve created on 2021-03-22 and active since 2019-01-01. Comments entered in Aquarius:  - Covers historical range of stage and discharge.   - 'Estimated' grade applied at lower end. Applied below 9.9cms (19.8cms / 2 = 9.9cms) and curve extended to 1cms/0.817m.  - 'Estimated' grade applied at upper end. Applied above 472cms/3.491m (236cms X 2 = 472cms) and extended to upper rating point at historic discharge peak of 597m/3.815m. BM 11 (BOTTOM OF SG ON RB STEEL WING DEFLECTOR) is 4.196m. Due to proximity to the bridge piers and wingwalls, the stage/discharge relationship at the upper end may not be accurate. It is highly likely that flows exceeding this elevation would enter a new control condition (likely backwater due to bridge components).   - 15 of 24 control-clear measurements since 2012 plot within 5% (outlier measurements excluded: 2012-06-14 & 2017-06-10).   - RMS (residual mean squares) for control-clear measurements is 5.1.",LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(0.65);
