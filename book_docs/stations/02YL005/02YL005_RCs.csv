02YL005,38.0,Curve # 38.00 is a clone of curve 37.00.  This curve was based on 5 open water measurements collected during 2023. All other measurmens were deleted beolow 0.533m were removed.  An adjustment to the upper end of the curve was also completed.,LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(0.533:0.042);(0.01);
02YL005,37.0,Curve # 37.00 is a high-water refinement above 0.600m and a complete change below 0.600m based on 2022 open water Measurements. Only 2022 measurements used below 0.600m,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(0.38:-0.002);(0.01);
