02HC058,7.00,"Changed slope to capture lowflow clear measurements over the past two years, as well as the top end measurements in spring of 2017",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(2.245);
02HC058,6,"To add estimated top end to capture the flow from June 23, 2015 event.  Low end has also been modified to fit recent measurements to the right.  Extreme low was extended for the summer low flows but graded 'E' as the measurements start having issues with variable velocity at the low end.",LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(2.245);
