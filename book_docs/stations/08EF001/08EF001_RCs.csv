08EF001,16.000,Break point accounts for side channel slightly upstream and across from station which becomes active around 6.4 m with vegetation and trees. Shift to right at low end from curve 15. Shift during ice period.,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(6.38:0.47);(0.5);
08EF001,15.000,Shift during ice period-Break point accounts for high flow backwater conditions caused by vagetation along banks and on island that forms when side channel becomed active around 6.5 m. The Kitselas Canyon constriction 1 km d/s of the gauge may also affect the upper end of the curve.,LogarithmicTable,Final/Finales,(6.445:0.6);(0.2);
