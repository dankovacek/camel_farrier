06FD002,9.0,"Curve 9.000 was created as a new curve to encompass all stage and discharge expected to be encountered during the operation of this 12-month station. On May 28, 2017 2 x all time high measurements where obtained using maned boat with a tethered M9 ADCP.  This site has a sand bar on the inside bend that changed in shape and size after the high water event.   All open water measurements from May 2017 to current were used in creating curve 9.000.  This includes all available data since the High water event changed the profile of the streambed.  When Choosing my rating points I do not have a point of zero flow, 2.3 m^3/s is half of the lowest measured flow.  At the top end 436 m^3/s was the highest measured and 50% above that brings it near 860 m^3/s.  After choosing my rating points and adjusting the slope, I had a slope of 1.600, the middle of a rectangular channel expected in the main channel and a slope of 3.0 as expected for a floodplain on the upper part of the channel.  I was unable to cover all ranges of stage without needing to use a break point. I placed a break point at 34.5m (4.5m above the bottom of the channel) using the M9 profile as a reference.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(34.54:29.827);(27.6);
