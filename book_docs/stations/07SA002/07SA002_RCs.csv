07SA002,6.0,"A single segment curve created to refine the low end of curve 5.0000. Although curve 5.000 is a good rating, the low-end hasnt been revisited with acoustic measurements until recently. Lower water measurements in 2023, 2022 and 2020 suggest that the low end of the curve is a little bit too far to the right. Curve 6.000 created to update this.",LogarithmicTable,Provisional/Provisoire,(25.1);
