This did not resolve the issue with the conuflow and stabilizing the pressure going to the orifice. Replaced the bubbler system with a new one.

BM-1 is the primary. First direct water level was from A-2019-51. I did not use the surveyed elevation at this time (just the established elevation of 9.53). This resulted in an incorrect reset for 5.870. Logger was reset to this value. I thought that I could just use the established evelation of the correct benchmark - but with a GC to this benchmark it would not work. So logger was incorrectly reset to 5.400. Completed a level tie, tying in both A-2019-51 and A-2018-RP-3 as the network is unstable (particularly A-2019-51). I put the established elevation into the first DWL to determine what the water level should have been. This resulted in a value of 5.389. As A-2019-51 was unstable, and enough time went by, another DWL was completed at 15:18 from the primary BM-1. This confirmed the value from the surveyed elevation matched the DWL found from the primary. SENSOR CORRECTLY RESET TO 5.388. A queen size mattress is frozen to the creek bed at the gauge pool.
