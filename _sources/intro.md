# Camel Farrier - Version control for open hydrological data quality management

This repository is intended to serve as a demonstration of the use of version control for open hydrological data management.

Each catchment folder contains geometric data (GeoJSON), attribute data (CSV), and a plot of the catchment polygon.

Version control of catchment polygons in an open-source repository is multi-purpose:
1.  **Transparency**: All changes to catchment polygons are tracked and can be reviewed.
2.  **Reproducibility**: The catchment polygons can be linked to specific versions of the attribute data.
3.  **Collaboration**: Multiple contributors can suggest changes to catchment polygons by sharing specific knowledge and evidence.

Git for version control is well suited to the management of catchment polygons because it is designed to track changes to many kinds of files,
and Github is particularly useful for its capacity for collaboration and automation.
